Feature: Redis auto failover
  In order to eliminate a single point of failure
  Beetle handlers should automatically switch to a new redis master in case of a redis master failure

  Background:
    Given a redis server "redis-1" exists as master
    And a redis server "redis-2" exists as slave of "redis-1"

  Scenario: Successful redis master switch

    And a redis configuration client "rc-client-2" using redis servers "redis-1,redis-2" exists
    And a beetle handler using the redis-master file from "rc-client-1" exists
    And redis server "redis-1" is down
    And the retry timeout for the redis master check is reached
    Then a system notification for "redis-1" not being available should be sent
    And the role of redis server "redis-2" should be "master"
    And the redis master file of the redis configuration server should contain "redis-2"
    And the redis master of "rc-client-1" should be "redis-2"
